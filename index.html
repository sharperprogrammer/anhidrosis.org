        <p>Anhidrosis is a condition where the ability to sweat is diminished or absent.  Some people 
            may sweat less than others and some may find that they hardly sweat at all.  This can be 
            dangerous, as your ability to sweat is your body's natural way of cooling itself. Without 
            proper sweating, the body is prone to overheating.  At best, this can lead to some 
            uncomfortable symptoms, but if left untreated can lead to heatstroke - a potentially 
            fatal condition.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The dangers of overheating include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Rapid pulse</li>
            <li>Anxiety and confusion</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken (in conjunction with advice from your doctor) 
            to reduce the symptoms of Anhidrosis.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay hydrated - just because your body isn't sweating enough doesn't mean your body isn't 
                using using water every day.
            </li>
            <li>Carry water with you on long walks - you use more water during moderate exercise.</li>
            <li>When walking or doing other cardio, start slow - for some people, the ability to sweat is
                diminished, but not absent.  If you start slow, and allow your body temperature to rise 
                more slowly, you give your body time to trigger a sweat response.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider carrying a spray bottle with water in it - if you have trouble sweating, you may 
                have to help your body with staying cool.  Splash or spray water on your skin when you get hot.
            </li>

        </ul>
